# HCI-iTalk
a website for EECS 330 Human Computer Interaction

In this group assignment, you will build a computer-based prototype of your project that includes three representative tasks. Your implementation should consist of a horizontal prototype of all features needed by your representative tasks (broad but shallow), plus a vertical prototype of one particular part of your interface (narrow and deep). Choose one feature of your design for vertical prototyping.

## High fidelity in look
Use this prototype to explore the graphic design of your final implementation. Lay out the controls as you want them to appear in your final implementation. Make choices about colors, fonts, alignment, icons, and white space.

##Medium fidelity in breadth
At the top level, your prototype should include every feature needed for three of your tasks. In other words, when you open your application, the user should see all of the options available for the three tasks.

##Mixed fidelity in depth
Shallow for most features, but deep in one feature. Leave out most of your implementation. Where system responses are needed, make them canned (i.e., always the same) or random. But implement your chosen feature deeply and thoroughly. Use realistic data in your canned displays, however -- in particular, data of a realistic scale. If you were building (say) an MP3 player and your prototype displays only three songs in the user's library, that's pretty unrealistic, and won't adequately test your UI design choices.

##Here are some issues you should not worry about in this prototype:
###Window resizing. 
When a window is resized, its layout has to adjust to respond. Don't worry about this for now. Determine a good default size for your windows and design a good layout for that size.

###Platform independence. 
Your prototype doesn't need to look good or work well everywhere. Focus on one platform for now, and just let us know what we should view it on (i.e. Chrome on Windows 8). That said, for any web application, please make sure it works with at least two major browsers.
