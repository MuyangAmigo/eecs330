      <h2>What made the US judiciary revoke the OPT-STEM (for F-1 students) extension after 5 years into implementation?</h2>

      <blockquote>
        This had to do with the way in which the extension became law, that is, the administrative process it when through. However, not to worry- all 'insider' indications I'm currently hearing are that this will be overturned and we'll continue with the program.
      </blockquote>

      <p>The international students are treated lessen than the illegals in this country. These people goes through so much struggle and competition to get till here and people cannot even stand them working for two and half years after spending thousands of dollars for their degree. I would suggest the government to focus on the illegals rather than the students. DHS has 6 months from now till Feb 12, 2016 to do Rule Making process to implement the STEM OPT Extension.
      </p>

      <p>Watch this 11 FAQ's About 17 Months STEM OPT Extension Cancellation answering FAQ's about this Court order and how long Rule Making would take to revert the court's decision. As the question states "what does the Cancellation mean to future students" - As of now, you do't have to panic and drop the plans to Study in USA. Just a quick update on this: it's not September and I'm hearing through the grapevine that this will not only be fixed, but it will be better... fingers crossed!
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Regular 12 Months OPT -  No Changes</li>
        <li>STEM OPT Extension  - Valid till Feb 12, 2016</li>
        <li>okay, this is the last line</li>

          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make.

          Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.<br> This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
